** Known bugs

- Collision issues: random speed resets may occur on some wavy ramps, especially
  on  the  Test Level.  This  is  because of  how  collision  is resolved  along
  linecasts, and will be solved at collision refactoring.
- Lack of  360° collision:  The full  360 degree  collision modes  are currently
  deactivated on  code because they  still need  work. Levels presented  in this
  demo do not have big loops, so it is not really a concern for gameplay on main
  levels.
- Small memory leak when respawning level:  For each item monitor respawned when
  the  player dies,  a memory  leak of  a  single byte  or two  may occur  since
  monitors use "extra properties" to determine their subtype. This will be fixed
  soon since object states now have a  proper subtype slot, but this memory leak
  will be insignificant on most scenarios,  and should only cause problems after
  an unrealistic number of respawns.
- Tails's tail  has no  hitbox: When flying,  Tails's tail cannot  be used  as a
  form of attack, so flying underneath bosses and enemies will hurt Tails.
- Characters  may   appear  slightly  above   ground  on  certain   objects  and
  platforms. This behaviour relates to how character rendering works and will be
  fixed once the new 360° collision feature is refactored.

* Free Objects build (2024-11-13 rev 01)

This build  introduces objects that  live freely on  a short object  pool. These
objects can have  a free position on the  world and may also hold X  and Y speed
information. So  now we can have  very interesting objects such  as moving rings
and shields, but also other kinds of objects as well!

This build had two revisions. The second one introduces a fix for the MDEC which
goes lighter  on the  disc reader,  so now  FMVs will  likely play  without much
hazzle.

- Add monitor image functionality with delayed behaviour
- Change debug  mode controls  within level screen  (change cycling,  add damage
  button)
- Changes in SWZ1, R0Z1, R1Z2
- Fix extended camera not moving when player direction changes at high speed
- Fixes   to  CD-ROM   usage   and   management  for   BGM   looping  and   MDEC
  playback. Minimizes stuttering!
- Add shield
- Add 1-Up sound effect
- Change title screen to start on Playground 1, but continue on Green Hill 1


* Collision, Fonts and Damage build (2024-11-07)

These builds  had many  attempts (six  reviews, over 15  burned discs)  until it
worked on  an actual SCPH-5501. Most  problems arised from the  way the hardware
