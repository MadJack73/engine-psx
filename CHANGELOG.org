  wearing off underwater

  "clunky" for now

* Christmas '24 build (2024-12-25)

* Dawn Canyon build (2024-11-16)

- Changes to R0Z1
- Add support for levels with no data (so levels can be built part by part)

  walls)
- Create  a centralized  BGM structure  with  support for  looping and  stopping
  points
- Add a BGM sound test on level select


* Free Objects build (2024-11-13 rev 01)

This build  introduces objects that  live freely on  a short object  pool. These
objects can have  a free position on the  world and may also hold X  and Y speed
information. So  now we can have  very interesting objects such  as moving rings
and shields, but also other kinds of objects as well!

This build had two revisions. The second one introduces a fix for the MDEC which
goes lighter  on the  disc reader,  so now  FMVs will  likely play  without much
hazzle.

- Add the concept of free (short-lived) objects and object pool
- Add ring loss with vertical collision
- Add monitor image functionality with delayed behaviour
- Change debug  mode controls  within level screen  (change cycling,  add damage
  button)
- Changes in SWZ1, R0Z1, R1Z2
- Fix extended camera not moving when player direction changes at high speed
- Fixes   to  CD-ROM   usage   and   management  for   BGM   looping  and   MDEC
  playback. Minimizes stuttering!
- Add shield
- Add 1-Up sound effect
- Change title screen to start on Playground 1, but continue on Green Hill 1


* Collision, Fonts and Damage build (2024-11-07)

and tiles.  Also adds many new  visual features to  make the game play  a little
more like it should. The player can also finally take damage.

These builds  had many  attempts (six  reviews, over 15  burned discs)  until it
worked on  an actual SCPH-5501. Most  problems arised from the  way the hardware
