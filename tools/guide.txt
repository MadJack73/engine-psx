* Startup

Everything starts with generating 16x16 tiles. You are welcome to start with 128x128 tiles if you find it easier,
but you'll have to control well your tiles so they don't add up much. Remember that VRAM is limited on the
PlayStation, so your art is going to have to be cut into 8x8 pieces, and these pieces should fill a 256x256
texture at max, at the end of these steps, and shouldn't have too many colors, so let's say you're constrained to
1023 tiles of 8x8 pixels (tile 0 is always a blank tile).

Your first step is creating a 16x16.png file with your 16x16 tiles. If you started working with 128x128, you could probably cut them up into a single sprite sheet with the aid of Aseprite.

* Generating 8x8 tiles and their 16x16 mappings

The following steps will allow you to create intermediate files 'tiles.png', 'map16.json' and 'collision16.json'.

You will also be able to cook these files into PlayStation-only engine files 'TILES.TIM', 'MAP16.MAP' and
'MAP16.COL'. These are binary equivalents to the files above, with only relevant information.

Extra files such as 'tiles16.tsx' will also be generated.

 1. Create 16x16.png tiles.
 2. Import 16x16.png tiles into a tiles16.tsx.
 3. Export tiles16.tsx from Tiled as collision16.json.
 4. Copy 16x16.png to 8x8.png.
 5. Open 8x8.png (still 16x16 tiles) on Aseprite.
 6. File > Import > Import Sprite Sheet. The single image will be used as one. Make it a 16x16 grid.
 7. Right click layer > Convert to > tilemap. Make it a 8x8 grid.
 8. File > Scripts > export_tilemap_psx. This will create a 8x8.json file. Rename it to map16.json.
 9. File > Scripts > export_tileset_psx. Use a 8x8 grid. This will overwrite 8x8.png. Rename it to tiles.png.
10. Open tiles.png with your favorite editor and make sure that all transparent pixels are set to color
    #000000 (black).
11. Use TIMTOOL.EXE (preferably) from Psy-Q library to generate a .TIM for your tiles. This will generate a
    TILES.TIM file on the same directory of the texture.
    12.1 Make sure you un-mark the "Set for Black" option in Semi Transparent Information.
    13.2 Make sure your tileset is at 448x0 and that the CLUT information is 4-bit depth and at 448x256.
         Notice that texture pages 8 and 24 are for level tiles and CLUT information, respectively.
12. Use the tool 'framepacker.py' to turn 'map16.json' into a 'MAP16.MAP' file.
13. Use the tool 'cookcollision.py' to turn 'collision16.json' into a 'MAP16.COL' file.

* Generating 128x128 tiles and mappings

The following steps will 

First of all, decide how you want to create these tiles. You *MUST* use the same tiles from your 16x16.png file.

I created my 128x128 tiles by creating a new infinite tilemap on Tiled and using 16x16.png as my tileset. Then
I just exported the tilemap as a .PNG file.
